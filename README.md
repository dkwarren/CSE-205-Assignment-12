# CSE-205-Assignment-12
Assignment 12 from ASU's CSE 205 class

This program demonstrates multithreaded abilities of CPUs. The applet starts with rotating arcs drawn along multiple angles. One can change the rate at which they are drawn, the amount of beams that are drawn, and the color in which they are drawn. It is also possible to start or stop the beams.
